  <p class="text"><strong>Python</strong> is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.</p>
  <p class="text">Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
  <p class="text">Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>
  <h4>Features and philosophy</h4>
  <p class="text">Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.</p>
  <p class="text">Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.</p>
  <p class="text">Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter(), map(), and reduce() functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, and sets; and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
  <p class="text">The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
    <li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
    <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
    <li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
    <li>Readability counts</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text">Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.</p>
